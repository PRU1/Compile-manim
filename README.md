# Compile-manim
A more user-friendly way to compile Manim using an MFC dialog application (currently Windows only, sorry)


## Installation
**This does not install [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim), you need to have Manim working for this** 

## Things that need to be changed

1. Save user preferences
2. Make cross-platform
